-----------------------------------------------------------

Folders : 

Frameworks : 
contains asp.net core share frameworks
have all asp.net core packages that installed while asp.net installed on system
 - packages related to hosting authentication and mvc app on 
.AspNetcore.app package

-NetCore.App
assembly that related to .net core app to run the .net core application
like System.Data,System.IO

Analyzers : 
analyse the code while developing
even we can able to create it by our own

Properties:
LaunchSettings.Json - Running app
Profile http,https used means while launching krestal web server is used to launch the application
its a built in cross platform web server

or IISExpress it has its webserver but not recommend

applicationurl : https://localhost:7050 has port details where application launched

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CityInfo.API.http - file is just for testing

appsettings.json connection string store

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WebApplication.CreateBuilder method is used for creating web application

program.cs
Services collecton is a build in dependency container used for including services while configure application
by injecting we can use it anywhere in our applicaton

builder.Services.AddControllers();
register services required to create api 
and other services are added like swaggerGen()

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
here WebApplication object implements interface iApplicationbuider this interface implements mechanism to configure request pipeline
var app = builder.Build(); afer registering services on the dependency container application get build

by using this we can configure how the application need to respond for individual http request - component handles these are called middleware


app.UseHttpsRedirection(); ----> turns http to https
app.UseAuthorization(); -----> authorization checks to https
app.MapControllers(); ---> map to controller

middlewares - software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle http requests and responses
