Questpond C# course

1. .Net framework - upto framework version 4.8 -windows specific
2. .Net Core - from version 3.1 - cross platform


commandline

dotnet new console
dotnet build
dotnet run

when download dotnet it stored on C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk
inside sdk folders has all set of libraries of that framework supports.

To use this libraries we need programming language

program/bin/debug/.netversion/machine_level_code
bin and obj folders created once we build the application

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

if multiple projects needs to start first like front end one project backend another one both are on one sln then on project-properties-multi startup projects
use arrow key to order which one to start first

if need to use another class logic then add reference it into project dependency and using keyword can used to import on current code

if common login needs to be shared across the application we may able to use dll and add reference to the project you need to use the reference.


= notes, drafts, and calculations while writing a book

bin = the printed book



What actually happens step-by-step

You press Build

Compiler:

Reads your .cs files

Uses obj to store intermediate results

Resolves NuGet packages (stored in obj)

Final .exe / .dll is written to bin

App runs only using files in bin

You can even:

Delete obj

Run the app from bin
→ it will work perfectly


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

c# supports multi language support
means one soln different language projects c#,F#,vb.net

all will convert to IL code here is the role of CTS and CLS

CTS helping all the programs datatypes to convert into common type
regardless how we mentioned on each programming language on each projects


CLS is a part of CTS and its just checking programming language rules and indicate if any rules are getting violated why defining datatypes.

exercise 2

How does a computer store data?
👉 All data is stored as binary (0s and 1s), grouped into bytes.

Byte data type & size
👉 byte is 1 byte (8 bits) and stores values from 0 to 255.

Char data type & size
👉 char is 2 bytes and stores a Unicode (UTF-16) character.

Why is char bigger than byte?
👉 Because char supports Unicode characters, which require 16 bits.

Char vs String
👉 char stores a single character, while string stores a sequence of characters and is immutable.

Signed vs Unsigned
👉 Signed types support negative values, unsigned types store only positive values with a larger range.

Short, Int, Long
👉 short is 2 bytes, int is 4 bytes, and long is 8 bytes.

Relation to Int16, Int32, Int64
👉 short, int, and long are aliases for Int16, Int32, and Int64.

Float, Double, Decimal sizes
👉 float is 4 bytes, double is 8 bytes, and decimal is 16 bytes.

Float vs Double vs Decimal
👉 Use float/double for performance and scientific calculations, decimal for financial accuracy.

How does casting affect performance?
👉 Casting adds extra CPU work and can reduce performance, especially inside loops.

Class : set of variables,functions and methods used as blue print for creating object
function -takes input and return value
methods - not return anything has return type void
Object- to make class by creating instance. Its a usable version of class
new keyword required

value - stack
reference - heap


structure is composite type and value type
used to avoid hanging variable
means memory value or pointer value is different

Arrays
fixed size,datatype is fixed, fast performance due to this
Int[] integeraray = new Int[5];
integeraray[0] = 12;
Arraylist - System.Collection
no fixed size,any datatype is possible,But all datatypes stored as object type means reference type so boxing and unboxing causes system slow
ArrayList alist = new ArrayList();
alist.add(10);
Generic list - 
List<int> glist = new List<int>();
glist.add(124);

Thread used to run multiple functios parallely
but to avoid thread affinity and cpu utilization taks is added

If you didn’t use Thread or Task.Run, no new thread was created.
A thread is a physical execution unit managed by the OS, while a task is a logical unit of work managed by .NET.
Threads are heavyweight and created explicitly, whereas tasks are lightweight, scheduled by the Task Parallel Library, and usually run on thread-pool threads.
Tasks improve scalability and abstraction, while threads give low-level control.
